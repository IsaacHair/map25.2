this architecture is the same as for the map25.2 except that
   *there is an aux register
   *there is an add function between that aux register and the gen register
   *rotation has a selector now, so any degree of rotation is possible
   *jzand and jzor are now things
   *system is 24 bits instead of 16 (this applies to everything)
